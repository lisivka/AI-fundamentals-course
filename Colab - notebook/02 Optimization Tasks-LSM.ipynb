Inventory Management\n","\n","**Inventory management** is the process of efficiently tracking and controlling the flow of goods or products in a business. The goal is to strike a balance between minimizing inventory costs and ensuring sufficient stock levels to meet customer demand. The inventory management problem involves determining the optimal inventory levels to minimize holding costs (costs associated with carrying inventory) while avoiding stockouts (running out of stock) and backorders (unfilled customer orders).\n","\n","Your task is to define `optimize_inventory_management()` function that takes the following inputs:\n","\n","- `demand`: A list representing the demand for each period (e.g., month, week) in the planning horizon.\n","- `holding_cost`: The cost of holding one unit of inventory for one period (e.g., month, week).\n","- `ordering_cost`: The cost of placing an order for a fixed quantity of inventory.\n","- `initial_inventory`: The initial inventory level at the beginning of the planning horizon.\n","- `reorder_point`: The inventory level at which a new order should be placed to avoid stockouts.\n","\n","The function `optimize_inventory_management` should return a list representing the optimal inventory levels for each period in the planning horizon.\n","\n","You have to use Linear Programming to find the optimal inventory levels for each period. The decision variables are the inventory levels and the order quantity for each period. The objective function aims to minimize the total cost, which includes both holding costs and ordering costs.\n","\n","Constraints ensure that the inventory at the beginning of each period is sufficient to meet the demand and the reorder point constraint.\n","\n","The PuLP library allows us to formulate the problem easily and efficiently. Once the Linear Programming problem is defined, we call model.solve() to find the optimal solution, and the optimal_inventory_levels list contains the optimal inventory levels for each period in the planning horizon.\n","\n","_Linear Programming Model:_\n","Decision Variables:\n","- inventory[period]: The inventory level at the beginning of each period.\n","- order_quantity[period]: The order quantity placed at the beginning of each period.\n","\n","Objective Function:\n","- Minimize the total cost, which includes holding costs and ordering costs for each period.\n","\n","Constraints:\n","- `inventory[0] == initial_inventory`: Initial inventory level constraint.\n","- `inventory[period] >= demand[period] + order_quantity[period] - inventory[period - 1]`: Inventory balance constraint.\n","- `inventory[period] <= reorder_point`: Reorder point constraint.\n","- `inventory[period] >= 0 and order_quantity[period] >= 0`: Non-negativity constraints.\n","\n","Note:\n","- The demand list should contain the demand for each period in the planning horizon.\n","- The `holding_cost` and `ordering_cost` are the costs per unit per period and per order, respectively.\n","- The `initial_inventory` is the initial inventory level at the beginning of the planning horizon.\n","- The `reorder_point` is the inventory level at which a new order should be placed.\n","- The function returns a list representing the optimal inventory levels for each period, including the initial period.\n","\n","> The provided function will assume that the demand for each period is known in advance and does not consider uncertainty in demand forecasts. Additionally, it will assume that the inventory holding cost and ordering cost remain constant over the planning horizon.
