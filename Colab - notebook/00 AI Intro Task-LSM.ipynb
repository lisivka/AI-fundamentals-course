It is often used as a decision-making tool or a playful way to make choices between two individuals. The game involves three hand shapes, each representing one of the three options: \"rock,\" \"paper,\" or \"scissors.\" The rules are straightforward:\n","\n","1. Rock crushes Scissors: Rock wins against Scissors.\n","2. Paper covers Rock: Paper wins against Rock.\n","3. Scissors cut Paper: Scissors win against Paper.\n","\n","The game follows a cyclic pattern, where each option beats one and loses to another. If both players choose the same option, the game results in a tie or draw.\n","\n","The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is typically played in a series of rounds. Each player makes their choice by forming one of the hand shapes (rock, paper, or scissors) simultaneously. Then, the choices are revealed, and the winner of the round is determined based on the rules above. The game continues until a predetermined number of rounds are completed, and the player with the most wins is declared the overall winner.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"1Mx3DgiidnfY","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700220939462,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":9998,"user":{"displayName":"lee scriber","userId":"13285270051983739409"}},"outputId":"b6931ee4-50cf-48a1-a933-b6ed2424c644"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting git+https://github.com/mehalyna/cooltest.git\n","  Cloning https://github.com/mehalyna/cooltest.git to /tmp/pip-req-build-cj94apvc\n","  Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/mehalyna/cooltest.git /tmp/pip-req-build-cj94apvc\n","  Resolved https://github.com/mehalyna/cooltest.git to commit f4c950440e06f6870bf813c9e2f1b253f1f497ba\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.15 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from cooltest==26.18) (1.23.5)\n","Building wheels for collected packages: cooltest\n","  Building wheel for cooltest (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for cooltest: filename=cooltest-26.18-py3-none-any.whl size=5420 sha256=cc4f8c7086a7adc6dc4b08062f9db6710da2178c47f0bee750d569a5be7f82c8\n","  Stored in directory: /tmp/pip-ephem-wheel-cache-td1462tz/wheels/5f/d0/08/46fba8323b078d91da2d05922a680d9728e94d53b453a8dd79\n","Successfully built cooltest\n","Installing collected packages: cooltest\n","Successfully installed cooltest-26.18\n"]}],"source":["!pip install git+https://github.com/mehalyna/cooltest.git"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"d5CQbiR4do4l","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1700220952466,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":9966,"user":{"displayName":"lee scriber","userId":"13285270051983739409"}},"outputId":"7474bc40-d56e-4188-9d99-0daafb803b52"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Pass\n"]}],"source":["from cooltest.test_cool_2 import *"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aZPJ8rt--GOg"},"source":["Your task is to write the body of function `play_rock_paper_scissors()` in such a way that it would be used to play the game with the computer.\n","\n","In this version of the function, the player's choice (from the user) and computer's choice (randomly generated) will be taken as input parameter.
