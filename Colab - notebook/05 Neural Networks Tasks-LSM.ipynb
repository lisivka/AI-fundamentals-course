Implement a Perceptron from Scratch\n","\n","**Problem:** Creating a Perceptron Model for XOR Classification\n","\n","**Task:** Develop a simple perceptron model using Python and NumPy to perform binary classification on the XOR problem.\n","\n","**Description:** The XOR problem involves classifying a set of input pairs `(x1, x2)` into two classes: 1 if the inputs are different (`0, 1` or `1, 0`), and 0 if the inputs are the same (`0, 0` or `1, 1`). A perceptron is a simple neural network model that can learn linear decision boundaries. In this task, you will create a perceptron, train it on the XOR dataset, and observe its classification performance.\n","\n","**Steps:**\n","1. Implement a Perceptron class with methods for initialization, activation, prediction, and training.\n","2. Initialize the perceptron's weights and bias with random values.\n","3. Define the XOR dataset: input features and corresponding labels.\n","4. Use the perceptron's `train` method to update weights and bias using the perceptron learning rule.\n","5. Test the trained perceptron on the XOR dataset and print its predictions.\n","\n","**Expected Output:**\n","For each input pair `(x1, x2)` in the XOR dataset, the perceptron should predict the corresponding class label (`0` or `1`). The final output should demonstrate the perceptron's ability to learn and classify the XOR problem.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WnVo5uLehuLZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0HIf6zoEhiVa","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699261634935,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1882,"user":{"displayName":"lee scriber","userId":"13285270051983739409"}},"outputId":"f34f1add-1611-494a-f590-ac700a2f5428"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 18328/100000, MSE: 0.0009999609405490306\n","Predictions:\n","Input: [0 0], Expect: [0] Predictions: [0] (0.036 , MSE: 0.00130)\n","Input: [0 1], Expect: [1] Predictions: [1] (0.970 , MSE: 0.00089)\n","Input: [1 0], Expect: [1] Predictions: [1] (0.970 , MSE: 0.00089)\n","Input: [1 1], Expect: [0] Predictions: [0] (0.030 , MSE: 0.00092)\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","class Perceptron:\n","    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size=3, output_size=1):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Initializes a simple perceptron model.\n","        Args:\n","            input_size (int): Number of input features.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.input_size = input_size\n","        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n","        self.output_size = output_size\n","        self.weights_input_hidden = np.random.rand(input_size, hidden_size)\n","        self.weights_hidden_output = np.random.rand(hidden_size, output_size)\n","        self.bias_hidden = np.random.rand(hidden_size)\n","        self.bias_output = np.random.rand(output_size)\n","\n","    def sigmoid(self, x):\n","        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n","\n","    def sigmoid_dx(self, x):\n","        return x * (1 -

This task involves visualizing the behavior of common activation functions: sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh (hyperbolic tangent). By plotting their graphs, you will gain insights into how they transform input values.\n","\n","**Steps:**\n","1. Implement the activation functions `sigmoid`, `relu`, and `tanh`.\n","2. Generate a range of input values for plotting.\n","3. Calculate the output values for each activation function using the provided input range.\n","4. Use Matplotlib to create a plot that shows the graphs of all three activation functions on the same plot.\n","5. Add labels, title, and legend to the plot to make it informative.\n","\n","**Expected Output:**\n","A single plot should display the graphs of the sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh activation functions. The x-axis should represent the input values, and the y-axis should represent the output values. Each activation function's graph should have a distinctive shape that showcases its unique characteristics.\n","\n","**Tips:**\n","- Sigmoid: S-shaped curve that maps input values to a range between 0 and 1.\n","- ReLU: Linear for positive values and zero for negative values, creating a hinge-like shape.\n","- tanh: S-shaped curve that maps input values to a range between -1 and 1.\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","This task will help you understand the effects of different activation functions on input data transformation. You'll observe how these functions introduce non-linearity, saturate, or allow only positive outputs, which are essential aspects of neural network

This task involves exploring the effects of different hyperparameters, such as learning rate and number of hidden units, on the performance of a neural network model. By conducting experiments with various hyperparameter values, you will gain insights into how these settings influence the training process and final results.\n","\n","**Steps:**\n","1. Implement a function to create a neural network model with a specified number of hidden units.\n","2. Implement a function to train the neural network model on the provided training data.\n","3. Define the hyperparameters to experiment with: learning rates and hidden units.\n","4.

Text Classification with Word Embeddings\n","\n","**Problem:** Text Classification with Word Embeddings\n","\n","**Task:** Train a Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis Using Word Embeddings\n","\n","**Description:** Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. This task involves training a simple neural network to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of text reviews. Word embeddings will be utilized to represent words in a dense vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words. The trained model will then predict whether a given text review has a positive or negative sentiment.\n","\n","**Steps:**\n","1. Load and preprocess the dataset of text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).\n","2. Tokenize the text data to convert it into sequences of numerical values (word indices).\n","3. Pad the sequences to ensure uniform length for neural network input.\n","4. Build a neural network model with an embedding layer to learn word representations and a dense output layer for binary sentiment classification.\n","5. Train the model using the tokenized and padded text data, aiming to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss.\n","6. Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n","\n","**Expected Output:**\n","A trained neural network model capable of predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of text reviews. This model should be able to process new text reviews and classify their sentiments accurately.\n","\n","**Tips:**\n","- Use a well-known dataset for sentiment analysis, such as IMDb movie reviews.\n","- Experiment with different hyperparameters like embedding dimension, number of hidden layers, and batch size.\n","- Visualize the training progress by plotting the loss and accuracy curves over epochs.\n","\n","**Learning Objectives:**\n","By completing this task, you'll gain practical experience in natural language processing and sentiment analysis. You'll understand the importance of word embeddings in capturing semantic information from text and how neural networks can be effectively used for text classification tasks.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wqgHt6oUoAww"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/SoftServe_DATAset/\n","!ls *.csv"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3jrefLAosKbz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699293549583,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":111137,"user":{"displayName":"lee scriber","userId":"13285270051983739409"}},"outputId":"b6666e0a-ca8e-4ea4-be61-07371bf72dbc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n","/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/SoftServe_DATAset\n","CyberBullying_Comments_Dataset.csv  features.csv  House_prices.csv  housing.csv\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.layers import Embedding, Flatten, Dense\n","from keras.losses import BinaryCrossentropy\n","from keras.optimizers import Adam\n","from keras.metrics import BinaryAccuracy, Precision, Recall, F1Score\n","from keras.models import load_model\n","\n","def prepare_data(texts, labels, max_words):\n","    texts_train, texts_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(texts, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","    labels_train = labels_train.astype('float32')\n","    labels_test = labels_test.astype('float32')\n","\n","    tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=max_words, oov_token=\"<OOV>\")\n","    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts_train)\n","    sequences_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts_train)\n","    sequences_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts_test)\n","\n","    max_sequence_length = max(len(sequences_train), len(sequences_test))\n","    sequences_train = pad_sequences(sequences_train, maxlen=max_sequence_length, padding='post').astype('float32')\n","    sequences_test = pad_sequences(sequences_test, maxlen=max_sequence_length, padding='post').astype('float32')\n","\n","    return sequences_train, labels_train, sequences_test, labels_test\n","\n","def create_model(max_words, embedding_dim, max_sequence_length):\n","    model = Sequential()\n","    model.add(Embedding(input_dim=max_words, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=max_sequence_length))\n","    model.add(Flatten())\n","    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n","\n","    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),\n","                  loss=BinaryCrossentropy(),\n","                  metrics=[BinaryAccuracy(), Precision(), Recall(), F1Score(),\n","                          ])\n","    return model\n","\n","def train_model(model, sequences_train, labels_train,  file_model, num_epochs=1, batch_size=64):\n","    model.fit(sequences_train, labels_train, epochs=num_epochs, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=0)\n","    # Save the trained model\n","    model.save(file_model)\n","\n","def evaluate_model(model, sequences_test, labels_test):\n","    # Evaluation of the model\n","    evaluation = model.evaluate(sequences_test, labels_test)\n","    print(\"Test Accuracy:\", evaluation[1])\n","    print(\"Test Precision:\", evaluation[2])\n","    print(\"Test Recall:\", evaluation[3])\n","    print(\"Test F1 Score:\", evaluation[4])\n","\n","\n","def run_train_sentiment_analysis_model(texts, labels, file_model, max_words, embedding_dim, num_epochs, batch_size):\n","\n","    sequences_train, labels_train, sequences_test, labels_test = prepare_data(texts, labels, max_words)\n","    model = create_model(max_words, embedding_dim, len(sequences_train[0]))\n","    train_model(model, sequences_train, labels_train, file_model, num_epochs, batch_size)\n","    evaluate_model(model, sequences_test, labels_test)\n","\n","\n","# Hyperparameters\n","max_words = 10000  # Максимальна кількість слів у словнику\n","embedding_dim = 100  # Розмірність вбудовування слів\n","num_epochs = 1  #\n","batch_size = 32\n","\n","# Load the data from the CSV file\n","data = pd.read_csv(\"CyberBullying_Comments_Dataset.csv\")\n","texts = data[\"Text\"]\n","labels = data[\"CB_Label\"]\n","file_model = \"CyberBullying_model_5.keras\"\n","model = run_train_sentiment_analysis_model(texts, labels, file_model, max_words, embedding_dim, num_epochs, batch_size)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XP3toiMmxack","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1699293750150,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":92991,"user":{"displayName":"lee scriber","userId":"13285270051983739409"}},"outputId":"200689fd-874f-4ce1-a0e4-96bd5024db8d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["70/70 [==============================] -
